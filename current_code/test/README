2. How are the tests constructed.
---------------------------------
Tests are generally categorised into three areas.

 * Test Coverage - ensure the tests are exhaustive.
 * Memory Management - ensure all code handles its memory correctly.
 * GUI Excersise - make the app does all it can

These are the main components:

 * setupRun.sh - Checks, builds and refreshes the environment.
                 builds the application and configures the testing
                 tools.
 * harness.pl  - decides what tests are going to be run, keeps track 
                 of passes/failes, and generates the results summary.
 * regressionTest/*.pm - Each actual test. 
                         0** - Are frontend tests
                         3** - Are backend tests
                         5** - App startup handeling

2.1. Test Coverage.
-------------------
To ensure all areas of code are tested, all tests should be run while 
the application is compiled in "--coverage" mode. The test coverage 
can then be analysted after each test run with lcov and genhtml.

2.2. Memory Management.
-----------------------
To ensure that memory is being managed correctly, each test case should 
be run ontop of valgrind. Valgrind will then produce a report of all 
memory and program logical errors.

2.3. GUI Excersise.
-------------------
The HtmlUnit (java) project is used to write scripts that interface to 
the application (via the perl test script).

2.4. Best Practice.
-------------------
To check the code base does not include common errors:
  cppcheck --verbose --enable=all src/
  splint -posix-lib -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I..  -DPACKAGE_LOCALE_DIR=\""/usr/local//locale"\" -DPACKAGE_SRC_DIR=\""."\" -DPACKAGE_DATA_DIR=\""/usr/local/share"\" -I/usr/include/uuid -I/usr/include/libxml2 -D__USE_XOPEN2K8=1 -D__builtin_va_list=va_list -weak src/*.c

3. Getting the GUI testing environment working
----------------------------------------------
You will need to install Java and the Perl JUnit wrapper

# run me with root privs
apt-get install default-jdk
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java cpan -f Inline::Java
cpan -f WWW::HtmlUnit

Also, Perl will need access to the database, so ensure DBI and sqlite3 DBD in installed
eg
sudo apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-perl



4. How to run the tests (automated).
-------------------------------------
cd test
./setupRun.sh
view './index.html' for the test results
