2. How are the tests constructed.
---------------------------------
The tests are generally caregoriesed into three areas.

 * Test Coverage - ensure the tests are exhaustive.
 * Memory Management - ensure all code handles its memory correctly.
 * GUI Excersise - make the app do all it can

2.1. Test Coverage.
-------------------
To ensure all areas of code are tested, all tests should be run while the application is compiled in "--coverage" mode. The test coverage can then be analysted after each test run with lcov and genhtml.

2.2. Memory Management.
-----------------------
To ensure that memory is being managed correctly, each test case should be run ontop of valgrind. Valgrind will then produce a report of all memory and program logical errors.

2.3. GUI Excersise.
-------------------
The LDTP project is used to write (and run) scripts that interface to the application (via assistive technologies).




3. How to run the tests (by hand).
------------------------
In general to run a test suit, you can do the following.

# Cleanup
rm src/*.gcda src/*.gcno test/valgrind.out test/lastRegression

# Compile, so that run coverage analysis reports can be generated.
make clean
./configure CFLAGS='--coverage' LIBS='-lgcov'
make

# Generate baseline (coverage) information
lcov -c -i -d src -o test/lastCoverage/app_base.info

# Start the app with memory management reporting enabled.
# G_SLICE=always-malloc G_DEBUG=gc-friendly valgrind --suppressions=/home/wbooth/.valgrind/gtk.suppression --suppressions=/home/wbooth/.valgrind/basic.suppression --leak-check=full --leak-resolution=high --error-limit=no --tool=memcheck --num-callers=50 --log-file=test/valgrind.out src/opendias

# Run automated tests
./test/harness 

# Collect process and build coverage report
lcov -c -d src -o test/lastCoverage/app_test.info
lcov -a test/lastCoverage/app_base.info -a test/lastCoverage/app_test.info -o test/lastCoverage/app_total.info
genhtml -o test/lastCoverage test/lastCoverage/app_total.info 


4. How to run the tests (automated).
cd test
./setupRun.sh
