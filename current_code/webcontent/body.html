  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p><strong>Welcome</strong> to opendias. The <strong>D</strong>ocument <strong>I</strong>maging <strong>A</strong>rchive <strong>S</strong>ystem.</p>
  <p>Opendias has been developed to help every household move 'paperless'. Use it to store correspondence that you would normal receive in a paper format - eg Statements, Bills, Letters, Pay Slips, etc...</p>


  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <p>There are a number of ways to help you keep track of your documents once they are archived:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OCR (optical character recognition) of the document contents, that can be searched on;</li>
    <li>Assign documents with multiple 'Tags', making it easier to find and group documents;</li>
    <li>Search by document date;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also, we have added some useful features while you're viewing or editing your document:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have the OCR'ed text read to you;</li>
    <li>Zoom in on a sliding multiple pages view of your document;</li>
    <li>Live saves back to the database (no 'save button');</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Architecture</h3>

    </a>
  </span>
  <p>The openDIAS architecture has been designed to allow many users to access the system.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The application connects to 'SANE' which gives you access to various scanning devices, both 
      locally or via the network (see SANE config setting for instructions how).</li>
    <li>Scanned images and the main database are stored on the server.</li>
    <li>Clients can connect from any location that can see the server, using a standard web browser.</li>
    <li>Access controls can be set up by 'clients location' or 'traditional username and password'.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Coming soon...</h3>
  <p>We are planning on adding more features just as soon as we can. See a selection below. If there is
    anything that you feel would help, do let us know.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Document printing direct from the view page;</li>
    <li>A 'For Attention' flag that can be used in searches, and shows in document lists;</li>
    <li>Location based and/or username/password access provisions;</li>
    <li>Document encryption, to keep your data safe;</li>
  </ul>
