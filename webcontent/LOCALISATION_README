This document applies to you, if:

  * You are thinking of localising opendias into a new language
    or adding new phases to current language packs.

First, thank you, it really is much appreciated.

Second, you should first read Section 5 (and specifically 
  Section 5.1 on how each localisation file is used, and what
  not to localise) of the main README file.

Over and above that, there are a few scripts and pointers to 
  help you.

 * If adding a new 'phase' to a language resouce file, either:
    * Add the correct localised text as per the language of 
      the file.
    * or, Add the English version prefixed with 'LOCALISE_ME'
      This will let us know where effort needs to be spent on 
      getting that phase transalated.

 * The script 'generate_new_language_pack.pl' will create a 
    new local version of each language resource file. Add
    these to git, but not any generated file, eg *.html.<lang>

 * The script 'build-local-versions.pl' (that is called by
    ./configure) creates the .html files used by the 
    application, from .tmpl and language resource files.
    However, it also:
    * Prints a warning when a phase contains 'LOCALISE_ME'
    * Stops processing, if a phrase is missing from any of
      the language resource files.
