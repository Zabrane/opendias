Some libraries we use are very memory intensive, which makes
testing functionality that uses then (using valgrind), very
slow (such as tesseract OCR). 
In reality were not interested in the function of these libs,
just how our program works, so we can safely stub these out 
with dumb implementations. That's what is contained in this
directory. do NOT use in production systems.
